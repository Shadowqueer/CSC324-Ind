Yeah, I kinda forgot about this. I'm not brilliant at remembering this sort of thing, and TBH I tend to work erratically anyway. 
I start this record on 3/7. There was quite a bit of work before that, including like 7 hours just creating the dataset, but I'm not sure when it was.

3/7: 5:25pm -> 6:50pm; worked primarily on ironing out data and converting the strings into usable lists. 
     7:40pm -> 8:40pm; spent a long time failing to put the string->list conversion into a function without really breaking it. Didn't succeed, going to have 
                       to go back to how I was doing it I think. It's sloppy, and repeats the same code a ton, but at least it works. 

3/8: 4:35pm -> 6:05pm; found solution to conversion function. I would have sworn I tried that last night. Whatever, it works now, got started on embedding 
                       it into greater setup function. Spend a lot of time working on Shiny UI and figuring out what and how to visulize with the extremely 
                       unusual dataset I've locked myself into. Mostly going to be percentage-based things (which is stunningly hard, turns out), but I have 
                       some ideas outside of that. Character Crossover, mostly. Script comparison and/or in play comparison. 
                       Note to self: need to update dataset, there have been more archives since I last.
     7:05pm -> 7:40pm; messed more with reactivity. only a somewhat productive session.
